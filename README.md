The purpose of this project was wo demonstrate building a React app from the ground up.  The timeline for this project was just under three weeks.  

This appication is designed to create a platform for Polymath Visuals, a 3D and motion design company, giving the ability to dispribute and sell plugin and texture packages for use with Cinema4D.  There are two sides of the appication.  The admin side which controls products and the user side which has the ability to browse and purchase those products.  Restful api used to control admin and user functionality.
